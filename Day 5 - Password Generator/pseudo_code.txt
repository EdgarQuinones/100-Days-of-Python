# How to make this random?
# generate letters, numbers, and symbols first
# put them into password in a random order
# pseudo code
# get the size of the password and amount of number/symbol/letters
# random generate if next character is one of those 3
# *** figure out how to remove that from the queue
    # pregenerate each in a full string, and slowly get rid of it...
        # get index of string and get full size, if string dosent == ""
            # if string == "", continue to different




# 2 letters: ab
# 2 numbers: 12
# 2 symbols: #$


# random combination of characters:


# # trial 1
# step 1: randomly pick a list
#     picked string "letters"
# step 2: randomly pick a character from the string
#     picked character "2"
# step 3: add character to password
#     hard_password += character(2)
# step 4: repeat until all strings are empty


# # trial 2
# step 1: randomly pick string
#     picked "numbers"
# step 2: check if string is empty
#     2a: if yes,
#     2b: if no, get random charcter from string


# # trial 3
# step 1: add all strings together


# loop through array, pop random portion of string
