What components do you need to keep in mind
when building the game Pong?

1. 2 paddles that can be moved by a player or 1 player/ 1 computer
2. a ball that bounces on the top/bottom walls but game ends when
it goes through left or right wall
3. Scoreboard tracking both players score
4. Colors and shape

extra:
if 2nd paddle is computer, must have it track ball and bounce back
to player. increase speed maybe?
