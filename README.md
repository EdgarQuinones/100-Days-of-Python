# 100 Days of Python
100 days, 100 Python projects, and notes from each day. This is currently in-progress.

As you view my projects, you will see 2 files in most directors. Demo.py, and main.py. The demo file is me learning said concept for that week, while the main file is the actual project for that day.

Along with notes from demo.py, I made a excel sheet that contains more notes on functions and other topics I learned everyday.
