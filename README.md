# 100 Days of Python: Started July 17th, 2024
100 days, 100 Python projects, and notes from each day. This is currently in progress.

Viewing my projects, you will see 2 files in most directors: Demo.py, and main.py. The demo file is me learning said concept for that day, while the main file is the actual project for that day. I will also at times contain a notes.txt file that shows my breakdown of a problem I'm working on.
